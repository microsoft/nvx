# Continuous integration

The GitHub Actions workflow has two microVM test layers on Azure-hosted
self-hosted KVM, MSHV, and WHP virtual machines. Each backend has a pool of
three runners labeled by operating system, backend, and `virtual-machine`.
Jobs target the shared backend labels so any available matching runner can
execute them. This allows the backend lanes to execute concurrently without
binding a workload to a specific host. `openvmm-tests` builds its Xen PVH probe
entirely from the OpenVMM checkout and exercises OpenVMM lifecycle, TTRPC, and
snapshot contracts without restoring NVX guest artifacts.
`nvx-microvm-tests` consumes the NVX Linux kernel and Alpine initramfs and
exercises Linux, SMP, virtio, sandbox, and snapshot behavior through the public
OpenVMM CLI. Failure logs from the NVX layer are uploaded per backend.
The restore-processor scenario also rejects Linux TSC instability diagnostics,
even if the requested CPUs came online, so clock skew cannot silently pass by
falling back to a different clocksource.

The `restore-tsc-sync` scenario repeats the 1/2/4/8-CPU restore sequence with
the test-only kernel option `clearcpuid=tsc_adjust`. Linux normally skips its
cross-CPU TSC warp test when `IA32_TSC_ADJUST` is available and consistent
within a package. This scenario verifies that the feature is masked, forcing
the live CPU-online check even on those hosts, while retaining the existing
TSC-instability guard. It does not force a fallback clocksource or retry failed
restores. Its logs are kept in a separate `restore-tsc-sync` subdirectory.
Run it alone on Windows with:

```powershell
python scripts\nvx.py test-microvm --backend whp --scenario restore-tsc-sync
```

This regression targets the WHP clock instability tracked in #19; a passing
frozen-counter check is not sufficient to validate a fix.

The `console-exit` scenario delays host console reads for two seconds after
snapshot restore to exercise output backpressure. For each requested processor
count it requires byte-exact delivery of a 64 KiB payload and the final marker,
and preserves guest exit statuses 0 and 37. This checks both device and host-relay
draining without adding sleeps to the measured benchmark workloads.
The harness waits for the output reader's EOF notification even after the
process exits, so delayed final output chunks cannot create a false failure.

Shared guest artifacts are built with Docker on a GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runner.
Once they are ready, benchmarks run in parallel with the NVX test layer and
use any available runner in the matching backend pool. All three use
virtual-machine performance series and the constrained eight-CPU affinity
policy. Development releases and performance baseline updates still require
every applicable test and benchmark lane to pass. The workflow uses the
read-only OpenVMM deploy key stored in the
`OPENVMM_DEPLOY_KEY` Actions secret to fetch the private submodule at its pinned
commit. Shared guest binaries and development release packages move through
runner-compatible Actions caches; benchmark results use short-lived workflow
artifacts.
Pull requests gate regressions against recent matching-platform history, and
successful pushes to `dev` append their p50 values under `data/`. Metadata-only
performance jobs use GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners. Provisioning instructions
are in the [runner bootstrap guide](../scripts/setup/README.md).

Persistent runners accept pushes and same-repository pull requests only. Fork
pull requests run the GitHub-hosted validation jobs but do not execute code on
the Azure runner fleet. A maintainer must stage an external contribution on a
trusted repository branch before running the backend matrices.
