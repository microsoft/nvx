# Build

Drive supported workflows directly through `scripts/nvx.py`; no Make wrapper
is required.

The portable workflow downloads the pinned Linux archive, verifies its
SHA-256, applies every patch in `kernel/patches`, and builds Linux plus the
Alpine initramfs in Docker. OpenVMM builds on the host:

```bash
python3 scripts/nvx.py build-guest
python3 scripts/nvx.py build-openvmm
```

On a Linux host, build the guest directly:

```bash
python3 scripts/nvx.py build-guest --native
```

The standard build produces:

```text
build/vmlinux
build/vmlinux.config
build/initramfs.cpio.gz
build/initramfs.cpio.gz.packages.json
openvmm/target/release/openvmm[.exe]
```

The initramfs includes the sandbox PID-1 bootstrap and its container namespace
helpers under `/sbin`. The matching kernel enables virtio-blk, compressed
EROFS, overlayfs, ext4 scratch, memory cgroups, and cgroup BPF. The build fails
if `olddefconfig` drops any required option, and the APK manifest records the
`blkid` and `util-linux` tools used by the bootstrap.

The native kernel build caches the verified and patched source under
`.cache/linux`, uses `O=build/linux`, runs `olddefconfig`, exports the exact
generated config as `build/vmlinux.config`, and fails if the Xen PVH note is
absent. Changing an archive hash or patch invalidates both source and object
caches.

## Building the packaged Linux source

The Linux corresponding-source archive contains the patched
`linux-6.18.38/` tree and the exact `vmlinux.config` used for the distributed
kernel.

On a Linux host with the kernel build dependencies installed, run from the
archive root:

```bash
mkdir build
cp vmlinux.config build/.config
make -C linux-6.18.38 O="$PWD/build" olddefconfig
make -C linux-6.18.38 O="$PWD/build" -j"$(nproc)" vmlinux
```

The normal repository workflow performs the same build through
`scripts/nvx.py build-kernel` or the Docker artifact target.
